  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hi! I'm Gürcan, an undergraduate high-honor student in psychology at TED University in Türkiye. I have been interested in websites, their structure, and design since my childhood. As my psychology education goes on, I wish to improve myself in full-stack web development. I'm a learner and, I will learn throughout my entire life.</p>
  <p>I wish you all a life that is full of learning and happiness!</p>
